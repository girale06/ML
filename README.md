# Basic Machine Learning Algorithms
1. Experimenting with the KNN algorithm

In the KNN.ipynb file I implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using Sklearn and also Tensorflow.

2. Solving MNIST digit classification problem

In this solution I use libraries like numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib.

3. Linear regression

In this little project I predict student performance using linear regression.
