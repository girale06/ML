# Basic Machine Learning Algorithms
1. Experimenting with the KNN algorithm

In the `KNN.ipynb` file I implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using Sklearn and also Tensorflow.

2. Solving MNIST digit classification problem

In this solution I use libraries like numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib.

3. Linear regression

In this little project I predict student performance using linear regression.

4. Python and numpy practice

In the file `Python_and_numpy_practice.ipynb` some homework exercises can be seen from my university's machine learning course.

These were assigned to practice Python and Numpy.
